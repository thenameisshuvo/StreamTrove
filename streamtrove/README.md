## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or above recommended)
- npm (v6 or above)
- A RapidAPI key for the YouTube Data API (set as `REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY` in a `.env` file)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd streamtrove
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your RapidAPI key:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_RAPID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
